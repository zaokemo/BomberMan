Creating a game like Bomberman in Unity involves several steps. Below is a technical document outlining the process:

1. Setting up the Project:
Create a new Unity project.
Set up the scene with a grid-based layout resembling the Bomberman arena.
Create player and enemy GameObjects for the characters to move around the grid.

2. Player Control:
Implement player movement using Unity's input system. Players move on a grid, so ensure that movement is constrained to grid cells.
Implement player actions such as placing bombs and triggering bomb explosions.

3. Bombs:
Create bomb GameObjects that players can place on the grid.
Implement a bomb placement mechanism that restricts the number of bombs a player can place simultaneously.
Add a timer to the bombs that triggers an explosion after a set period.

4. Explosions:
Create explosion GameObjects representing the blast radius of bombs.
Implement logic to detect when a bomb explodes and trigger the explosion animation.
Calculate the blast radius of explosions and determine which objects are affected by the blast.

5. Power-ups:
Create power-up GameObjects that provide temporary advantages to players, such as increased bomb range or speed.
Implement logic to randomly spawn power-ups on the grid and allow players to collect them.

6. Enemies:
Create enemy GameObjects representing opponents or AI-controlled characters.
Implement enemy movement patterns and behavior, such as chasing players or avoiding bomb explosions.

7. Collision Detection:
Implement collision detection between players, enemies, bombs, explosions, and other game elements.
Handle interactions between different objects, such as players being eliminated by explosions or collecting power-ups.

8. Scoring and UI:
Implement a scoring system to keep track of points earned by players.
Create a user interface to display the current score, remaining lives, and other relevant game information.

9. Audio and Visual Effects:
Add sound effects for placing bombs, triggering explosions, collecting power-ups, and other game events.
Implement visual effects, such as animations for bomb explosions, character movements, and power-up activations.

10. Level Design:
Design multiple levels with varying layouts, obstacles, and enemy placements to increase the game's complexity and replay value.

11. Testing and Optimization:
Test the game thoroughly to ensure smooth gameplay and correct behavior.
Optimize the game for performance, especially if targeting mobile or low-end devices.

12. Polishing and Additional Features:
Add polish to the game by refining visuals, adjusting difficulty levels, and improving UI elements.
Consider adding additional features, such as multiplayer mode, different game modes, or custom level editors, to enhance replay value.

13. Publishing:
Once the game is complete and tested, build it for your target platforms.
Distribute the game through app stores or online platforms if desired.

Throughout the development process, refer to online tutorials, documentation, and resources to overcome challenges and learn new techniques. 
Additionally, seek feedback from playtesters and other developers to improve the game further. Have fun creating your version of Bomberman!
